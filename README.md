## Screenshots

> SplameiPlay Studio is still under early development. We'll add screenshots once it's closer to a release

## Requirements
- Windows 7 (SP1) or later
  - Windows 7, 8 and 8.1 may require additional apps to be installed to work
- .NET Framework 4.7.2 (pre-installed on modern Windows)
- An active internet connection

## Installation

### Via SplameiPlay (Mainline)

SplameiPlay Studio (should) be a native project to SplameiPlay. Because of this, you should be able to go into the store page, find 'SplameiPlay Studio' and install like you would with other projects.

> [!NOTE]  
>  As of writing, SplameiPlay Studio is not available on the Stable and Beta channels and can only be natively installed on the Alpha channel

### Via an installer file

> [!NOTE]
> The official installer file using the 2.0 (SplameiPlay Flow 1.2) server syntax. This means you cannot currently use the installer file on SplameiPlay Lite or Beta + Stable SplameiPlay Mainline builds

1. Download the latest installer file from the [release page](https://github.com/splameiplay/splameiplay-studio/releases) (It will end in `.spinstaller`)
2. Open the downloaded file and accept the add prompt
3. After adding, you should see it in the main window (Lite) or the home page (Mainline after refreshing). You can now install it the same way you normally would

### Portable install

1. Download the latest portable release from the [release page](https://github.com/splameiplay/splameiplay-studio/releases) (It will end in `.zip`)
2. Extract the downloaded file
3. Run the file named `SplameiPlay Studio.exe`

> It's not recommended to use this method because SplameiPlay Studio will not be automatically updated which can result in you making outdated SplameiPlay files that won't work with the latest SplameiPlay app releases
